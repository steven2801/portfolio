## Short Description (Microsite Builder) ✏️

Have you ever seen similar sites looking like the picture above? Microsite builders like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/)
and [S.id](https://home.s.id/) allows you to build one just like that. This site is exactly that kind of site, where you
can customize your own single page site with links directing to your other socials.

## Project Goals 🎯

I wanted to learn how to use socket.io, and I chose to clone monkeytype because they did not have a multiplayer feature
(actually I found out that they do, after finishing my project 🤦‍♂️).

## Features 🔧

- Command Palette (switch between themes, modes, font family, etc.)
- Top 100 Leaderboard (daily and all time)
- Multiplayer Gameplay
- Public and Room Chat
- Mobile responsive

## Technologies Used 💻

This site is built using Nextjs, Tailwind, Socket.io, Strapi, and deployed [here](https://mtype.vercel.app) using
Vercel.
